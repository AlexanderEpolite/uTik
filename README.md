Discord bot which automatically downloads TikTok videos when a TikTok link is posted in chat.

## Invite the bot

You can invite the bot [using this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1031412241083416576&permissions=0&scope=bot)

## Self-hosting

This part of the guide is for people who want to host an instance of the bot locally.

Make sure [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is installed and accessible from the path.

Also make sure that FFMPEG is installed and on the path:
- Windows: Install FFMPEG from [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ffmpeg)
- MacOS: Install FFMPEG through [Brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg)
- Debian/Ubuntu-based: `apt install ffmpeg`
- Other Linux Distros: find in your package manager.

Create `secrets.json` in the same directory as this file with the following data:
```json
{
    "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
}
```

Install dependencies with `npm i`, compile with `tsc`, and run `dist/uTik.js` to start the bot.
